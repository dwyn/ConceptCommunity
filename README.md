# Concept Community
In its infancy, Cocnept Community is a place for Flatiron Students and Faculty to submit ideas (read: concepts) for future students to build for portfolio projects. Specifically speaking when students can't think of something to build for a portfolio project.

## Motivation
At The Flatiron School, portfolio projects are a great way to demonstrate a how well students grasp concepts taught throughout the curriculum. One of the hardest parts of every portfolio project is knowing *what* to build! Enter Concept Commununity! Current Flatiron students and faculty can log into Concept Community, and submit ideas for future students to build for portofolio projects.
